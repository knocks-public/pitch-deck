## Introduction

**Inro**: Zero-Knowledge Proof Age Verification System.
Proving age without compromising personal information

---

## Problem Statement

Age checks often reveal too much personal information like your name, address, and photo. This harms your privacy and raises the risk of data theft.

---

## Innovative Solutions

Show a QR code on your smartphone instead of an ID. That's it. No extra devices needed. Zero-knowledge proofs confirm age without revealing personal details.

---

## How It Works

- **For Users**:
  1. **Scan ID**: Users scan their ID using the Inro app.
  2. **Generate QR Code**: The app generates a QR code that proves their age.

- **For Verifiers**:
  1. **Scan QR Code**: Verifiers scan the user's QR code.
  2. **Confirm Age**: They confirm the user's age without seeing other personal details.
